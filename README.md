## The story

May 2026. A 29-year-old vocational-school graduate from rural Yunnan,
China — handle **Mx-Shell** — used **10 days** and a few thousand RMB of
cloud credits to make a 3-minute AI short called *Zombie Cleaner*: an
atomic-punk robot wanders into a beachfront villa after a zombie
apocalypse, meets a confused ostrich, and starts dancing
1980s-style breakdance moves while kicking a zombie's head across
the floor.

Hollywood director **PJ Ace (@PJaccetturo)** retweeted the film, calling
it *"one of the best short films in recent years"* and started a manhunt
for the author.

A few weeks later Mx-Shell went on a Douyin livestream and **gave away
his entire workflow** — the prompts, the camera language, the failure
modes, the rerolls.

This repo is the result of digesting 130,000 characters of his materials
into a structured, reusable system.

## TL;DR — The 5-stage prompt structure

Every Mx-Shell video prompt follows the same skeleton. The order matters:

```
1. Core theme            ← 3-6 style tags separated by |
2. Character & scene     ← Face / clothing / environment
3. Atmosphere & quality  ← Visual base / color tone / style core
4. Camera rules          ← Single-shot or multi-shot / angle / breathing
5. Storyboard            ← Per-second OR per-shot breakdown
```

### Three counter-intuitive rules

1. **Specify real camera + lens models.**
   Don't write *"cinematic feel"*. Write
   *"simulated IMAX film camera, Panavision C-series lens, 35mm focal,
   f/4 aperture."* AI training data binds those exact strings to real
   movie aesthetics.

2. **Describe imperfections.**
   *"Battle-damaged armor, paint worn off, oil in the joints, minor
   facial blemishes preserved."* Perfection looks fake. The visceral
   realism comes from the flaws.

3. **Leave the ending empty.**
   *"No dialogue. No explosion. No blinding light.
   Just a figure standing in the smoke, a meteor crossing the sky."*

## Install the Skill (Claude Code users)

```bash
# Option 1 — Try it inside this repo
git clone https://github.com/jnMetaCode/ai-shortfilm-prompts.git
cd ai-shortfilm-prompts
claude   # then type /shortfilm-prompt

# Option 2 — Make it available globally
mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills
cp -r ai-shortfilm-prompts/.claude/skills/shortfilm-prompt \
      ~/.claude/skills/

# Option 3 — As a submodule in your own project
git submodule add https://github.com/jnMetaCode/ai-shortfilm-prompts.git \
                  .claude/skills/_shortfilm
```

Then in Claude Code:

```
/shortfilm-prompt  Help me write a 15-second prompt for a robot
                   transformation, green color palette, energy core in
                   the belt buckle, post-apocalyptic jungle background
```

The Skill walks through the 5-stage structure, runs a 10-item self-check,
and warns you about IP names that may be blocked by Seedance 2.0.

## Compatible video models

The 5-stage structure is **model-agnostic**. Verified to work well with:

| Model | Notes |
|---|---|
| Seedance 2.0 (Doubao Xiaoyunque, 沉浸式短片) | Mx-Shell's primary engine. **Avoid the "Fast" variant** — quality drops. Strict IP-name filter. |
| Sora | Prefers concise prompts. Keep 5 stages but trim per-section length. |
| Kling (可灵) | More permissive on IP names. Needs *more* explicit motion description. |
| Jimeng (即梦) | Strong 3D feel — emphasize "no game-CG feel" extra hard. |
| Veo | Works well; English prompts preferred. |
