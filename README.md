This repository is **the complete workflow behind that film**, made
available because Mx-Shell himself published his prompt collection
documents and walked through his entire method on a public Douyin
livestream.

## ⚡ The single-line magic prompt (try it tonight)

Copy this into Sora / Seedance / Kling / Veo. Replace `{{...}}`:

```
Anamorphic widescreen cinematic. Simulated IMAX film camera +
Panavision C-series lens (35mm focal, f/4 aperture). Handheld
shot — extremely subtle, breath-like camera float throughout.
{{your scene description}}.
No score. Production audio only.
```

**Why this works**: real camera bodies + "breath-like float" anchor
the AI to actual film aesthetics — not the vague "cinematic feel"
keyword everyone else uses. Full breakdown in
[methodology.md](./methodology.md).

## ❌ vs ✅ — what the method actually changes

Same idea: *a female mech warrior raises an energy shield in a thunderstorm.*

**❌ The naive prompt** (what most people write):

```
Epic cinematic shot of a beautiful female mech warrior activating a
stunning energy shield in the rain. Highly detailed, 4K, photorealistic,
movie-quality, dramatic lighting.
```

Vague praise — *epic / stunning / 4K / movie-quality* — gives the model
nothing concrete to anchor to. You get generic game-CG output.

**✅ With the 5-stage method** (excerpt):

```
Core theme: gritty hard sci-fi mech | rainy dock | battle-damage aesthetic | energy shield | post-apocalyptic live-action
Atmosphere: simulated IMAX film camera + Panavision C-series (35mm, f/4). Low-saturation teal base, film grain.
Camera: handheld — extremely subtle, breath-like float throughout.
9–12s: hexagonal energy cells light up unevenly, some flicker as if faulty; rain bends around a 2m dome.
Ending: no dialogue, no light burst — just rain vaporizing on the shield, a lightning flash across the dock.
```

Real camera/lens names + physical reactions + battle damage + an empty
ending = visceral realism. Full sample with the 10-item self-check:
[examples/02-skill-output-sample.md](./.claude/skills/shortfilm-prompt/examples/02-skill-output-sample.md).

## The story

May 2026. A 29-year-old vocational-school graduate from rural Yunnan,
China — handle **Mx-Shell** — used **10 days** and ~20,000 RMB of
cloud credits to make a 3-minute AI short called *Zombie Scavenger*:
an atomic-punk robot wanders into a beachfront villa after a zombie
apocalypse, meets a confused ostrich, and starts dancing
1980s-style breakdance moves while kicking a zombie's head across
the floor.

Hollywood director **PJ Ace (@PJaccetturo)** retweeted the film,
calling it *"one of the best short films I've seen in years"* and started a
search for the author.

A few weeks later Mx-Shell went on a Douyin livestream and **gave
away his entire workflow** — the prompts, the camera language, the
failure modes, the reroll counts.

This repo is the result of digesting 130,000 characters of his
materials into a structured, reusable system.

## TL;DR — The 5-stage prompt structure

<p align="center">
  <img src="./assets/5-stage-structure.svg" alt="The 5-stage prompt structure" width="660">
</p>

Every Mx-Shell video prompt follows the same skeleton. The order matters:

```
1. Core theme            ← 3-6 style tags separated by |
2. Character & scene     ← Face / clothing / environment
3. Atmosphere & quality  ← Visual base / color tone / style core
4. Camera rules          ← Single-shot or multi-shot / angle / breathing
5. Storyboard            ← Per-second OR per-shot breakdown
```

### Three counter-intuitive rules

1. **Specify real camera + lens models.**
   Don't write *"cinematic feel"*. Write
   *"simulated IMAX film camera, Panavision C-series lens, 35mm focal,
   f/4 aperture."* AI training data binds those exact strings to real
   movie aesthetics.

2. **Describe imperfections.**
   *"Battle-damaged armor, paint worn off, oil in the joints, minor
   facial blemishes preserved."* Perfection looks fake. The visceral
   realism comes from the flaws.

3. **Leave the ending empty.**
   *"No dialogue. No explosion. No blinding light.
   Just a figure standing in the smoke, a meteor crossing the sky."*

Full methodology in [methodology.md](./methodology.md).

## Install (Claude Code)

### Option 1 — Plugin Marketplace ⭐ (one-line install)

```
/plugin marketplace add jnMetaCode/ai-shortfilm-prompts
/plugin install ai-shortfilm-prompts@ai-shortfilm-prompts
```

Then in Claude Code:

```
/ai-shortfilm-prompts:shortfilm-prompt  Help me write a 15-second prompt for a
                                        robot transformation, green color palette,
                                        energy core in the belt buckle,
                                        post-apocalyptic jungle background
```

### Option 2 — Try it inside this repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jnMetaCode/ai-shortfilm-prompts.git
cd ai-shortfilm-prompts
claude   # then type /shortfilm-prompt
```

### Option 3 — Make it available globally (manual copy)

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills
cp -r ai-shortfilm-prompts/.claude/skills/shortfilm-prompt \
      ~/.claude/skills/
```

### Option 4 — As a submodule in your own project

```bash
git submodule add https://github.com/jnMetaCode/ai-shortfilm-prompts.git \
                  .claude/skills/_shortfilm
```

The Skill walks through the 5-stage structure, runs a 10-item self-check,
and warns you about IP names that may be blocked by Seedance 2.0.

---

## Compatible video models

The 5-stage structure is **model-agnostic**. Verified to work well with:

| Model | Notes |
|---|---|
| Seedance 2.0 (Doubao Xiaoyunque, 沉浸式短片) | Mx-Shell's primary engine. **Avoid the "Fast" variant** — quality drops. Strict IP-name filter. |
| Sora | Prefers concise prompts. Keep 5 stages but trim per-section length. |
| Kling (可灵) | More permissive on IP names. Needs *more* explicit motion description. |
| Jimeng (即梦) | Strong 3D feel — emphasize "no game-CG feel" extra hard. |
| Veo | Works well; English prompts preferred. |
