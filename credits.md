## What this repo does

What this repo **does not** do:
- Does not rewrite, expand, or "re-create" Mx-Shell's original prompts
- Does not strip his name or impersonate him

What this repo **does** do:
- Distills [methodology.md](./methodology.md) — the systematic 5-stage
  structure from his livestream + documents
- Consolidates [faq.md](./faq.md) — his 17 troubleshooting items plus
  scattered Q&A
- Converts the docx/doc files into structured markdown
  (`原始提示词/`)
- Extracts the [model templates](./模板/) — IP-stripped reusable bones
- Provides a [Claude Code Skill](./.claude/skills/shortfilm-prompt/) so
  Claude can produce prompts following his methodology

Every `原始提示词/` file marks its source document and date.

## Mx-Shell's stance on sharing

From the March 15 document (item 17):

> *"This Kamen Rider thing was just a whim. I didn't expect this much
> attention. Thanks everyone for liking it. If you joined the fan group
> just to grab the prompts and then leave — fine, I don't mind.*
>
> *I'm sharing my prompts with you. Use my templates as a starting
> point. Let your imagination run.*
>
> *Several people in my group have already written excellent prompts
> from these templates. Feel free to swap learnings."*

From the May 12 livestream:

> *"You can learn this, you can take it and do whatever — I don't care.*
>
> *I source from atom-punk. The image I used is the one you see. Anyone
> claiming I scraped from a game — go check, I never wrote any IP names
> in my prompts."*

> *"I hope this lets the Chinese AI scene draw some inspiration from
> what I shared today. Not saying I'm a benchmark — just hoping it
> helps someone."*

## On IP names in original prompts

Mx-Shell's original prompts contain some IP names:

- 仮面ライダー BLACK SUN (Kamen Rider BLACK SUN)
- Gundam
- Pacific Rim
- Ready Player One
- Metal Gear Solid
- Kai'Sa (League of Legends)
- Iron Man
- Michael Jackson (referenced for dance style)

These IP rights belong to their respective owners. This repo retains
the original prompts as **faithful records of the source material**.
When using them:

1. Seedance 2.0 is known to filter IP names — direct use often gets
   **blocked**
2. Commercial use requires clearing rights with each IP holder
3. Personal learning / non-commercial use is lower risk but still
   advisable to substitute with style descriptions

The [模板/](./模板/) directory contains IP-stripped generalized versions.
